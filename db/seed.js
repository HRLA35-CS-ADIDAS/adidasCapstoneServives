        "review": "I didn't expect these to be this comfortable. Wow. Very nice. I usually wear size 13, but went up a half size with these based on previous reviews saying that these shoes are a bit narrow. They are snug, but I think I would have been fine with my normal size of 13. I bought these because I liked the look of them, I won't be skateboarding in these as I'm a 30 something and don't want to break my legs, with that said I don't see these lasting that long scraping across grip tape all day as there really isn't much extra padding where you would scrape your foot to do an Ollie. So I wouldn't use these as your primary skate shoe. I could see walking in these all day with no problem.",

        "review": "So this shoe is perfect in all departments minus durability. If it lasted longer than 1 day of skating I'd give it 5 stars, no doubt. Looks super stylish and is comfortable enough for the first wear. I feel like I'd have had these worn in after 2 or 3 more skate sessions, so comfort isn't a foreseeable issue. The fit is as expected, maybe a tad more narrow than your average shoe. In short, this shoe is 5 out of 5 for a lifestyle shoe; HOWEVER, this is a SKATE SHOE! I skated for 3 hours and my shoe deteriorated worse than my years old NIKE SBs. I hate trashing this shoe, because I want to love it and did. Unfortunately, when the product just falls apart immediately you feel as if you were robbed or lied to in the advertising. Save your money if you want to skate with these, spend your money if you wish to just use them as the fresh kicks they are. Too bad my fresh kicks almost have a hole in them already.",

        "review": "I think these shoes are beautiful. I wear them almost everyday and they are very comfortable. They are stylish and go very well with khakis. My friend has these exact same shoes and he skateboards and says they are great for it. They are grippy to the board and to your feet. If you bought the right size (which by the the way these shoes should fit exactly to your shoe size) the soles grip your socks and hug your feet so they won't slip off or anything while you are skating. Even if you don't skate, these shoes are still 100% recommended as they just look very nice. One thing that is worth noting however, is that the insoles cannot be removed (at least not intentionally) so if you have orthopedic soles, you may want to steer clear of them. Luckily I do not, and honestly I think the soles in these shoes are comfortable as well. They are slightly firm but I'd assume that may have to do with skateboarding considering these shoes are made for that. Otherwise I love these shoes and would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants stylish shoes to go very well with khakis, or grippy shoes for skateboarding.",

        "review": "Awright, so I like the look of these shoes, but they are not comfortable if you have to walk for an extended period of time. All other pairs of Adidas I bought in the past were super comfortable. They were so painful on the soles of my feet that I had to stop and buy some gel insoles on the way to my destination. Luckily I bought them a half size bigger, so they could accommodate the insoles. Also, the back of the shoe rubs on your achilles, so I had to buy some special cushion pads to protect the back of my feet. I'm giving them a few more days of wear to see how it goes. I'll be returning them if they don't feel better soon.",

These resembled the usual pair of Vans skate shoes that I regularly wear so I decided to give them a shot. But they're very narrow. They fit but they rub against my feet on all sides, especially along my arches and Achilles tendon leaving blisters on the back of my heels. They're not totally terrible but not ideal for long walks or a job on your feet. Would not buy these again.",

        "review": "I thought that since this shoe was sold my Amazon and not a third party I wouldn't have to worry about this being a cheap knock off, I was wrong.This is the second pair of name brand shoes I bought from Amazon that are already starting to fall apart after only 3-4 months. Its not like I walk around the city all day either, I have a desk job so these have minimal use.  I have another pair of Adidas that I've had for 7 years (I know, gross) and that have seen a lot more action (really gross) and they are still in better shape than the pair I got from Amazon.  Only difference is my other paid of Adidas I got from a physical store.It's not worth it to buy this shoe (or any shoe in my experience) on Amazon, even if its cheaper than somewhere else because you will still be overpaying for a poor quality product that Amazon makes you think is higher quality.",

        "review": "I cannot remark on how these perform for skateboarding as I have other pairs I use for that. These are what I use for light use. They fit as expected, maybe a tiny bit on the tighter side depending on how tight you lace up. They look a tiny bit lighter in person but still pretty accurate to the photo. I like the low profile of them as well. Bootcut or baggy jeans cover up the shoe quite a bit so you may want to steer away from wearing those styles with these shoes but it's a matter of preference.",

        "review": "Unfortunately one of the worst pair of shoes I have ever owned. First impressions were great, but within a few hours of wearing them, I developed painful blisters on the back of my ankles from the shoe collar relentlessly digging into my achilles. The problem stems from the rigid structure of the shoe as well as any lack of padding at the heel, which is an odd design choice considering there is padding mostly everywhere else in the shoe. I have continued to wear them believing that perhaps the issue could be resolved by breaking them in, but my efforts have ultimately been futile, with the same painful result time after time. If you're looking for a great skate shoe, do yourself a favor and buy a pair of Vans.",

        "review": "Flat-soled skate shoes are my go-to, and it's safe to say I really like these. I have never owned other Adidas shoes, so not a lot of reference there. The fit is similar to Vans or Converse, the upper is rather thin but surprisingly more stiff than canvas. The insole could be softer, but for the price I could simply replace the insole to have something cheaper and better than many ~$100 shoes I've had. The outsole has a lot of grip, which I've found good for skateboarding.Aside from the cushion, my only other negative remark is that these shoes are taking a while to break in. I've probably walked 20 miles in them and they're still rather stiff. This might turn into a good thing, as they may last longer than other shoes I've had. Their stiffness has also made them my most comfortable shoes for skateboarding.",

I tried to be counterculture for so long but decided to see what the mainstream answer to skate shoes were. I was really surprised by how comfy these were compared to Vans and the overall silhouette is the same. The structure also seems to be a lot more solid minus the lack of a padded tongue, but that isn't something I'll miss anyway. Honestly, this opens me up to Adidas overall. Very happy with this purchase.",

These absolutely lived up to my expectations. I live in a very wet climate so I’m constantly getting shoes dirty, but these have already stood the test. I’ve been wearing them for almost every day and I have yet to have to given them a thorough clean, just a simple wipe down. Better yet, they don’t stain or wear out quickly due to the material used.Also a plus, it’s not Nike. :)",

However, the fit it a bit too small. Also, they feel very stiff. I thought this would go away after breaking them in but after 3 months of wearing them, I'm disappointed to say that they have not.Overall good shoe. Great build quality. Just make just you don't wear them for a prolonged period, else foot pain will be inevitable.",

I wear these for office use, but change to go on walks because it caused the back of my ankle to get a scab.  Hoping it softens over time because they have held up.",

However, after trying them on and worn for 1 day, my feet are hurting very badly due to narrower than usual fit in front part of the shoes.  I compared those shoes with my other shoes and discovered that those shoes are narrower than even size 8.5.  So the width of those shoes are no where near standard size 9.  One must buy at least a full size up if you want to fit well.",

I normally skate with vans but these are similar enough for me. they fit my feet perfectly, they're inexpensive, and they're a little warmer than vans when skating in the winter. they seem to have slightly more padding on the part that goes over the top of your foot than typical vans. my only complaint is that the part that goes around the back of your heel digs into my heel a little bit but that's probably because of my foot and not the shoes.",

The thinner topline on these Seeley’s are better looking and still have some padding for more comfort than you would get from the classic vans. My food is a bit too wide on the left shoe it seems, but they still need to be worn more and broken in. I would like to get another pair in a different color because I’m more than pleased with this purchase.",

I forgot, too, that one cannot wear canvas shoes like these while walking the dog through wet grass in the morning. Rats. The shoes immediately become soggy, although they dry after about 24 hrs. without staining, shrinking or visible damage.They will be very satisfactory, though, if you have a narrow foot and accept that they are definitely not for wet grass or wet weather. Me? Next pair of these casual shoes I buy will have vinyl uppers.",

The Neo lasted me many, many years until the sole wore all the way through and I was tearing up socks while walking... That being said, the shoe itself was made with decent material. The Seeley on the other hand, at first glance and while holding/wearing it, seems to have very thin material. The shoe looks great, almost better than my Neos, but I just cant get over the construction of the shoe. I'll update this in a few months with my thoughts.",
